## Features

- Render current file

The main goal of this extension is to replicate **Current Module View** feature from CodeSandbox inside of VSCode.

## Usage

Run `Preview Current Module ðŸ“ƒðŸ‘€` command in a file that writes to the DOM.

We're using Parcel to allow importing JavaScript, TypeScript, Reason and all of the stuff Parcel just gets with no config.

## Roadmap

- [] Improve React experience -- ReactDOM.render default export if `currentModulePreview.mode: "react"` is set

<!-- > Tip: Many popular extensions utilize animations. This is an excellent way to show off your extension! We recommend short, focused animations that are easy to follow. -->

<!-- ## Extension Settings

Include if your extension adds any VS Code settings through the `contributes.configuration` extension point.

For example:

This extension contributes the following settings:

- `myExtension.enable`: enable/disable this extension
- `myExtension.thing`: set to `blah` to do something -->
